# Learning Java
 A repository for my adventures in java
 
# Quickstart

- Requirements
    - JDK 17 or above

- Not required but for easier use:
    - Download an IDE with Java support like IntelliJ or Eclipse.


# Running 
Using an IDE is a simple as opening the project and running the code throught the IDE.

If you don't want any of that you can run it directly from the Terminal following this [guide](
